Day two of soaking things in water
some stuff you can just let soak
and sometimes I can't wash stuff
last time somebody washed my stuff
was before college probably

I always feel better after a shower
or a swim
but I don't like how my finger look pruny afterwards
sometimes a shower feels like a chore if you're busy
but no matter what, after I get in I could just stay

It's mostly dishes I 
feel like people will let their dishes soak a
lot of the time
