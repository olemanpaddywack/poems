my roommate sings karaoke
and isnt very good at it

he comes home from work
goes to his room
and sings in his room

he isnt even that good
but at least hes not that loud

when hes off work
he can go for hours
and sometimes its the same songs

hes not getting any better
and he will be quiet when i am
having guests over

everything else about him is normal

but he finds the music online
and will just sing along
sometimes for hours

he has friends
and a family and a job
i guess i just dont get it
